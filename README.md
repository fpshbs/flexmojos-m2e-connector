Setup your environment
----------------------

1.  Compile and install the dependencies.

    You need first to install the m2e-flexmojos-runtime pom.xml, this maven module contain the dependencies required by the connector.
    If you have not already fetched the git submodule required (m2e-core), run the following command in the project root:
    <pre>git submodule update</pre>
    Then, install the maven artifact by running: <pre>mvn -f m2e-flexmojos-runtime/pom.xml clean install</pre>

2.  Create a p2 repository from FlashBuilder plugins and features.

    The UpdateSite Publisher Application (org.eclipse.equinox.p2.publisher.UpdateSitePublisher) is a headless application that is capable of generating metadata (p2 repositories) from an update site containing a site.xml, bundles and features.
    
    In eclipse, create a new configuration: Run > Run Configurations... Select Eclipse Application.
    In the fieldset "Program to Run" select "Run an application" and choose org.eclipse.equinox.p2.publisher.FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher.
    In the Arguments tab, in the text area "Program arguments", put the following:
    <pre>
      -metadataRepository file:/&#060;some location&#062;\repository
      -artifactRepository file:/&#060;some location&#062;\repository
      -source &#060;location with a plugin and feature directory&#062;
      -configs gtk.linux.x86
      -compress
      -publishArtifacts
    </pre>

    Run the configuration.

    Note: you can have more information on creating a p2 repository in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Publisher#Features_And_Bundles_Publisher_Application.

3.  Compile the project

    Add the repository you created in your .m2/settings.xml in a profile as follow:

        <profiles>
          <profile>
            <id>flex-mojos</id>
            <repositories>
              <repository>
                <id>fb47</id>
                <layout>p2</layout>
                <url>file:/<some location>\repository</url>
              </repository>
            </repositories>
          </profile>
          
          ...
          
        </profiles>

    Do not forget to use this profile when invoking maven on the project! It will allows Tycho to use the FlashBuilder 4.7 platform when building the m2e connector plugin. Note that you will also need to set-up a target in eclipse to use the plugins and features of your FlashBuilder installation.
