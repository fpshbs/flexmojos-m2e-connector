Setup your environment
----------------------

1.  Clean and install the dependencies.

    If you have not already fetched the git submodule required (m2e-core), run the following command in the project root:
    <pre>git submodule update</pre>
    This will pull the tag 1.2.0 of the m2e-core repository in your project, it is required as m2e-flexmojos is built against this version.

    You need to install the maven module *m2e-flexmojos-runtime*, this maven module contain the runtime dependencies required by the connector.
    Install the maven artifact by running: <pre>mvn -f m2e-flexmojos-runtime/pom.xml clean install</pre>

2.  Create the Flash Builder 4.x target platform as a p2 repository.

    The Features and Bundles Publisher Application (org.eclipse.equinox.p2.publisher.FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher) is a headless application that is capable of generating metadata (p2 repositories) from pre-build Eclipse bundles and features.
    
    In eclipse, create a new configuration: Run > Run Configurations... Select Eclipse Application.
    In the fieldset "Program to Run" select "Run an application" and choose org.eclipse.equinox.p2.publisher.FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher.
    In the Arguments tab, put the following in the text area "Program arguments":

        -metadataRepository file:<some location>\repository
        -artifactRepository file:<some location>\repository
        -source <location with a plugin and feature directory>;
        -configs gtk.linux.x86
        -compress
        -publishArtifacts

    In this example, the plugins in */&lt;location with a plugin and feature directory&gt;/plugins* and features in */&lt;location with a plugin and feature directory&gt;/features* will be published in the *file:/&lt;some location&gt;/repository* repository. The artifacts will also be published, and the repositories (artifacts.xml and content.xml) compressed.
    Run the configuration and repeat this step for each Flash Builder installation you have: 4.0, 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7. This will create different target platform.

    Note: you can have more information on creating a p2 repository in http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Publisher#Features_And_Bundles_Publisher_Application.

3.  Compile the project.

    Add the repository you created in your .m2/settings.xml in a profile as follow:

        <profiles>
          <profile>
            <id>m2e-flexmojos</id>
            <repositories>
              <repository>
                <id>fb-46</id>
                <layout>p2</layout>
                <url>file:/<some location>\repository</url>
              </repository>
              
              <repository>
                <id>fb-47</id>
                <layout>p2</layout>
                <url>file:/<some location>\repository</url>
              </repository>
            </repositories>
          </profile>
          
          ...
          
        </profiles>

    Do not forget to use this profile when invoking maven on the project! It will allows Tycho to use the Flash Builder 4.x platform when building the m2e connector plugin. Note that you will also need to set-up a new Target Definition in eclipse to use the plugins and features of your Flash Builder installation.
    
    Run mvn clean install on the project root.
